**How Can I Cure My Tinnitus In 2021.**

Usually, a doctor will diagnose tinnitus based on symptoms alone. But to treat these symptoms, he or she will try to determine if the cause of tinnitus is due to another underlying condition. Sometimes the cause cannot be determined.
To help determine the cause of your tinnitus, your doctor will likely ask about your medical history and examine your ears, head, and neck. Common tests include:
Hearing examination. During this test, you’ll sit in a sound-isolated room wearing earphones that transmit specific sounds into each ear individually. You’ll be asked to make a signal when you hear the sound, and your results are then compared with results that are normal for your age.
* This can help rule out or identify possible causes of tinnitus.
the movement. Your doctor may ask you to move your eyes, clench your jaw, or move your neck, arms, and legs. If tinnitus changes or worsens, this may help identify an underlying disorder that needs treatment.
* Imaging tests. Depending on the suspected cause of tinnitus, you may need imaging tests such as a CT scan or an MRI.
Laboratory examinations.
* The doctor may draw a blood sample to check for anemia, thyroid problems, heart disease, or vitamin deficiencies.
Make sure you describe to your doctor the kind of noise you hear from tinnitus as accurately as possible. The sounds you hear can help your doctor determine a possible underlying cause.

**crackling sound;** This type of sound indicates that a possible cause of tinnitus is muscle contractions in and around your ear.

**A throbbing, hissing, or humming sound.** These sounds usually arise from causes related to blood vessels, such as high blood pressure, and you may notice them when doing physical exertion or changing positions, for example when lying down or standing.

**Low-class resonance.** This type of sound may indicate a blockage in the ear canal, Meniere’s disease, or a stiff inner ear bone (otosclerosis).

**High pitched resonance.** This is the sound most commonly associated with tinnitus. Possible causes include exposure to loud noises, hearing loss, or taking certain medications. An acoustic neuroma can cause a continuous high-pitched ringing in one ear.

**Treatment**

Treatment for tinnitus depends on its cause and whether it is caused by an underlying health condition. If tinnitus is due to an underlying cause, your doctor may be able to relieve symptoms by treating the underlying cause. Examples include:

**Earwax removal.** Removing a blockage caused by earwax can help reduce tinnitus symptoms.

**Treat any vascular problem.** Underlying blood vessel problems may need medication, surgery or other treatment to get rid of them.

**Hearing aids:** If tinnitus is caused by noise or age-related hearing loss, hearing aids may help relieve symptoms.

**Change the medications you take.** If a medication you’re taking appears to be causing your tinnitus, your doctor may recommend stopping, reducing or changing the amount you’re taking and using an alternative medication.

**Noise Suppression.**

Often, tinnitus cannot be cured. But there are treatments that can help reduce symptoms. Your doctor may suggest using an electronic device to suppress the noises. Examples of these devices include:

**White noise devices.**

These devices, which emit environmental sounds or static sounds, such as rain falling or sea waves roaring, are often an effective treatment for tinnitus. You can try a white noise machine with cushioned speakers, to help you sleep. Fans, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners in the bedroom may also produce a white noise that helps reduce tinnitus.

**Tinnitus suppression devices.**

These in-ear devices, similar to hearing aids, emit a continuous, low-pitched white noise that helps mask tinnitus symptoms.

**Consultation.**

Behavioral treatment options aim to help you cope with tinnitus by trying to change the way you think and feel about your symptoms. Over time, tinnitus may become less bothersome. Consultation options include:

**Tinnitus treatment with retraining.**

Tinnitus retraining is an individual program usually run by an audiologist, or at a tinnitus treatment center. Tinnitus therapy with retraining combines masking with moral guidance from a trained professional. Typically during this program, you wear a device in your ear that helps mask tinnitus symptoms while you also receive guidance counseling. Over time, a tinnitus retraining program may help reduce tinnitus and lessen the discomfort of symptoms.

**Cognitive-behavioral therapy or other forms of counseling.**

A certified mental health professional or psychologist can help you learn coping techniques to make tinnitus symptoms less bothersome. Counseling can also help with other problems commonly associated with tinnitus, including anxiety and depression. Many mental health professionals offer CBT in individual or group sessions, and CBT programs are also available online.

**Pharmaceutical**

Tinnitus cannot be treated with medication, but in some cases, it may help reduce the severity of symptoms or complications. To ease symptoms, your doctor may prescribe medication to treat the underlying condition causing tinnitus or the anxiety and depression that often accompany tinnitus.

**Possible future treatments**

Researchers are studying the possibility of relieving tinnitus symptoms using magnetic or electrical brain stimulation, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation.
